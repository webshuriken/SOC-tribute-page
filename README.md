# Soc Tribute Page

A one page tribute page to Props Road Fools BMXing documentary.


## Features

- Fully responsive


## Purpose

The creation of this project was part of the application process to join the School of Code bootcamp.

**Learning Journey step 7**

You will now be using git and vscode to:

  * _clone_ your repository to your local machine (use the HTTPS link)

  * _update_ the sample HTML and CSS files with your own code (from CodePen) 

  * _add, commit and push_ your changes to your brand new repository. Pretty cool eh?

**Deploy the site using GitHub pages**

Follow the guide [HERE](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

Make sure that the deployed branch is `main` in settings.
