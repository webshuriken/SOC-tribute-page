        <p>Props Road Fools first season was released in 1998. The team behind the production took a bunch of riders, loaded them on to a trailer and drove around different states.</p>
        <p>Each rider had their speciality, whether it was street or ramps. This would create an atmosphere where they would push the boudaries, trying out new and exciting tricks while supporting one another.</p>
        <p>The documentary style series would carry on for a total of 18 seasons. With every season the riders get better and better.. These guys are always coming up with stuff you never thought could be possible. I found it very inspiring.</p>
        <p>Of all the road fools only one season really stuck with me and that was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1dJo9BmGio" target="_blank">Road Fools 14</a>, check it out.</p>
